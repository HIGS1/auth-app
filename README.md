A very Simple Authentication System with the following features:
 - User Sign In
 - User Sign Up
 - User Password Reset
 - User Verfication
 - GUI (Single Authentication Window):
    * Sign In Page
    * Sign Up Page

The program was written entirely in Python.

The GUI Framework used for the Front-end was [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/)

The Back-end service used was [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/).

The .exe Build was created using the [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
